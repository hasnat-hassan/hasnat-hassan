# 👋 Hi, I’m Hasnat Hassan

I'm a passionate **Front-End Developer** with a solid foundation in building modern, scalable web applications using **React**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. I love turning high-fidelity Figma designs into pixel-perfect, responsive UIs and integrating APIs to bring apps to life.
